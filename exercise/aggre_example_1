# Create an aggregation named "popular_carriers" that calculates the number of flights grouped by the `Carrier` field
# Add a sub-aggregation to "popular_carriers", named "carrier_stats_delay", that computes stats over the value of the `FlightDelayMin` field for the related bucket of carriers
# Add a second sub-aggregation to "popular_carriers", named "carrier_max_delay", that shows the flight having the maximum value of the `FlightDelayMin` field for the related bucket of carriers
